### State management

All invoice state lives in `App.jsx` as a single `invoices` array. The four state operations — `addInvoice`, `updateInvoice`, `deleteInvoice`, and `markAsPaid` — are passed down as props. This keeps the data flow simple and predictable without needing a context or external store.

### Data persistence

Two `useEffect` hooks in `App.jsx` handle persistence:
- Invoices are saved to `localStorage` under the key `invoice-app-data` on every state change
- On mount, invoices are loaded from localStorage (falling back to seed data if empty)
- Theme preference is stored separately under the key `theme`

### Dark mode

Tailwind v4 dark mode is configured with `@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *))` in `index.css`. The `isDark` state in `App.jsx` toggles the `dark` class on `document.documentElement`, which triggers all `dark:` utility classes globally.

## Trade-offs

- **No backend** — data is persisted in localStorage rather than a database. This means data is per-browser and not shared across devices. A Node/Express or Next.js API route could be added to make it persistent server-side.
- **Props drilling over Context** — state is passed as props through two levels (App → Pages → Form). For this app size it's clear and maintainable; a larger app would benefit from React Context or Zustand.
- **Seed data on first load** — if localStorage is empty the app pre-populates with sample invoices so reviewers can see the app in a useful state immediately.
- **No optimistic UI** — edits and deletes update state synchronously since there's no async API layer. This would need to change with a real backend.

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML throughout — `<header>`, `<aside>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<label>`, `<button>`
- All form fields have associated `<label>` elements
- Delete modal uses `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, and `aria-labelledby`
- Modal closes on `Escape` key via a `keydown` event listener
- Filter dropdown closes on outside click via a `mousedown` listener
- Status badges use sufficient colour contrast for WCAG AA compliance in both light and dark modes
- Interactive elements all have visible hover and focus states
- Images have descriptive `alt` attributes

---

## Improvements Beyond Requirements

- **Seed data fallback** — new users see real invoice examples rather than a blank app
- **Responsive item rows in detail view** — mobile shows `qty x price → total` format instead of a 4-column table that would overflow on small screens
- **Fixed bottom action bar on mobile** — Edit / Delete / Mark as Paid float above the content on mobile, matching the Figma design exactly
- **Arrow rotation on filter toggle** — the chevron rotates 180° when the dropdown is open for clear affordance
- **`flex-shrink-0` on header actions** — prevents the Filter + New button row from collapsing at very narrow viewports
